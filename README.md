The ReX CSS Framework is the base for all technology provided by the ReX project. This site contains CSS examples for all of our ReX components, as well as documentation on those components.

## 👍 Easy to start, fun and familiar to use
The ReX CSS framework, follows common naming conventions and standards used by Twitter Bootstrap because we have used some part of it to accelerate initial development. This should make it quite easy to use for developers who are familiar with Bootstrap, however we do not claim to be compatible now or in the future with any Twitter Bootstrap versions or be affiliated with Bootstrap in any other way.
## ❤️ Full of working examples
In order to use these styles, you will need to include the appropriate HTML structure in your code. We provide examples of proper code structure for each component on their respective pages.
## ⚡️ Need interaction?
In most cases, to achieve interaction, basic component-level logic, and motion with components, JavaScript is required. We are currently developing each components in the React JavaScript library.


# Get started
## Local Development
Install dependencies and start development

```
npm install
npm start

a server will start at [localhost:8081](http://localhost:8081).


## Building for Production
Create minified bundle for deployment in the `build` directory.

This command will create all themes in the `build/themes`, and also copy rex-icon-font in the `build/fonts` directory.
